# Spanish Sentence Embeddings

Spanish sentence embeddings computed using [sent2vec](https://github.com/epfml/sent2vec) on the [Spanish Unannotated Corpora](https://github.com/josecannete/unannotated-spanish-corpora).

## Pre-Processing

The data used was already preprocessed in [Spanish Unannotated Corpora](https://github.com/josecannete/unannotated-spanish-corpora) to lowercase, remove multiple spaces, remove urls and others. We also used the script to split on punctuation included in the previous repository.

According to that tokenization, the 2.6B words corpus got into 3.4B tokens.

## sent2vec Parameters

We set default parameters of sent2vec.
